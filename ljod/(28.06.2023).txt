as you embrace me with your being
and whisper your words of wisdom,
I get swept into a state of consciousness
I thought I had lost on my journey in time.
my emotions struggle to identify themselves,
but you assist me in caressing each one 
in the palm of my hand,
seeing them eye to eye without judgment.
as you hum your song softly 
I join your singing
and watch you put the sun to sleep
